    summary:   'The Fountainhead\'s protagonist, Howard Roark, is an individualistic young architect who refuses to compromise his artistic and personal vision for worldly recognition and success. The book follows his battle to practice what the public sees as modern architecture, which he believes to be superior, despite an establishment centered on tradition-worship. How others in the novel relate to Roark demonstrates Rand\'s various archetypes of human character, all of which are variants between Roark, the author\'s ideal man of independence and integrity, and what she described as the "second-handers". The complex relationships between Roark and the various kinds of individuals who assist or hinder his progress, or both, allow the novel to be at once a romantic drama and a philosophical work. Roark is Rand\'s embodiment of what she believes to be the ideal man, and his struggle reflects Rand\'s personal belief that individualism trumps collectivism.'
